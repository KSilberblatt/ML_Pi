# **Goals/ToDo**
*Update and change goals as they are completed and to keep track of what to learn*

* Learn about machine learning practices
  * Use/Learn Tensor Flow
    * Use/Learn Keras
      * regulizers?
      * dropout?
    * Optimizers?
    * Loss? (accuracy vs loss)
    * Metrics?


  * Understand how the ML process works
    * Neural networks -*see references*-
      * embedding layer
      * global average cooling layer
      * overfit and underfit
    * beginner alternatives to neural networks
      * k-nearest neighbors -*see references*-
      * decision trees
    * epochs?

* Learn how to program a Raspberry Pi 3 b+

* Decide how to handle multiple dice - options:
  * Image parsing - recognize objects that are dice
    * crop the image onto each die


* Make initial plan
* Structure markdown
* Structure repository
* Make MVP
* Make additional features section
* Play with Raspberry Pi
* Make rough UX
* Transition this ReadME out of note and into about project



### *Finished:*
> * buy materials
> * start github project
> * initialize notes structure

## **Important random notes**
*delete when memorized or when sorted in a better place*
* Randomize training data and order of input
* When to stop training data? -When loss is no longer decreasing *early stopping method in Keras*
